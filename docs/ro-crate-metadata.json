Specifically:\n\n\n\nWhat is the adoption of open licenses?\n\nDo research projects include a description?\n\nHow well documented are research projects? (i.e., in terms of installation instructions, requirements and documentation availability\n\n\n\nRQ5:\u00a0What are the most common citation practices among communities?\n\n\nThe dataset has two types of information, for example for one cluster we can say \"ENVRI\", for each RQ you will find \"analysis_envri_rq1.json\" which contains the information extracted using SOMEF and processed to extract the relevant information, and you will find \"results_envri_rq1.json\" which is the calculations of the percentages of each relevant files to the RQ.",
